Do you want to go to Balan?
You become too emotional about it.

Ms. Da Silva, why
Do not you try to reason with him?

And what is freedom?
does it really mean to us?

339
00:29:39,761 --> 00:29:43,288
Being stuck in the system of
castes, is it freedom?

Do not worry, we will finance.

360
00:31:14,088 --> 00:31:14,088
This is not a question of the manager,
which is especially important to the people.

361
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:18,159
Is there a subject on which
you want me to write?

362
00:31:21,029 --> 00:31:21,029
See you, as long as your writings continue
To increase our number of readers.

If you say so ..

364
00:31:26,234 --> 00:31:28,202
Manseur, I have a great idea!

365
00:31:28,369 --> 00:31:28,369
_e think q_on should
to sensitize the Indians

366
00:31:31,439 --> 00:31:35,000
to the fact that they have a
very rich story.

367
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:51,754
The mocchi (shoemaker),
symbol of craftsmanship,

368
00:31:51,926 --> 00:31:51,926
taut at the Iong of his
life, he seems to know

369
00:31:53,928 --> 00:31:56,294
no interest other
than his job.

370
00:31:56,464 --> 00:32:00,127
His work is slow, rudimentary
and even proving.

371
00:32:00,301 --> 00:32:03,168
however, his work is for
it is the very essence of life.

372
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:06,166
Outside of his profession,
there was no existence.

373
00:32:06,374 --> 00:32:09,400
A mocchi is not even
a nam of its own:

374
00:32:09,544 --> 00:32:09,544
iIs considered to be
a mocchiet

375
00:32:11,713 --> 00:32:14,375
everyone knows him
like '' the mocchi ''.

376
00:32:11,713 --> 00:32:14,477
By ordering the shoes,
It is the story of the spirits of those who

377
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:23,490
are dying
to observe it.

378
00:32:23,624 --> 00:32:26,616
From his face, the world can get
sacred healings.

379
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:27,195
Maybe the mother
We have not arrived yet

380

387
00:32:49,651 --> 00:32:49,651
Do you want to be known as a shoemaker?
It's so humble.

388
00:32:53,254 --> 00:32:55,085
I want to remain anonymous, sir.

I can take you there.

444
00:38:28,255 --> 00:38:29,483
Here is a (abIe:

445
00:38:29,957 --> 00:38:33,051
One day, a man sees a monkey
sitting on the edge of a river,

446
00:38:33,193 --> 00:38:36,321
he picks fish one by one
and align them on the shore.

447

Obviously, the fishes are

448
00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:42,164
Shock of the show, the man
ask the monkey, '' What are you doing? ''

449
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:45,933
The monkey replies, "It does not happen?
I save the fish from the nayade. ''

450
00:38:47,475 --> 00:38:51,275
We are often like these monkeys
who are trying to save these fish!

451
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:57,047
No, I'm not suggesting that
you are monkeys, I spoke of sadhus.

452
00:38:57,518 --> 00:38:59,986
Some saddles may be
impasteurs, but not all.

453
00:39:00,121 --> 00:39:01,952
Religion is
opium of the people

454
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:04,057
and I will catch and
to announce all these dealers!

455

If _is really this
what you want to do,

456
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:07,518
there is someone with whom
I would like you to start.

457
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:10,495
This is a sadhu that you can
state publicly,

458
00:39:10,564 --> 00:39:11,929
are you leaving?

459
00:39:15,069 --> 00:39:17,435

00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:07,728
As a doctor, you knew
although he had no hope,

507

malgrėtoutvousles
bernezetleurdemandez

508
00:44:12,466 --> 00:44:14,593
to see a God who
I do not think so.

509
00:44:15,336 --> 00:44:19,363
Prayer is the invocation
of the Supreme in you.

510
00:44:19,473 --> 00:44:23,432
This is not a false hope, _a
give you immense strength.

511
00:44:24,678 --> 00:44:26,373
Hari Om Swamiji.

512
00:44:31,718 --> 00:44:34,186
EtencequicancerneDieu,

513
00:44:34,355 --> 00:44:37,483
if you're referring to shapes
and the reprstions that

514
00:44:37,625 --> 00:44:39,650
we are going to share with us,

515
00:44:39,827 --> 00:44:42,387
so obviously II riexiste
not this (a_on.

516
00:44:42,796 --> 00:44:44,593
These are just symbols,

517
00:44:44,898 --> 00:44:49,232
creed representations of
this Infinite Infinite Vėritė.

518
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:52,564
But if you're referring to
the presence of God,

519
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:53,540
do not we see His presence
all around naus,

520
00:44:56,544 --> 00:44:59,035
Every moment, every second,

521
00:44:59,313 --> 00:45:01,645
in this entire cycle of

522
00:45:01,815 --> 00:45:06,684
creation, preservation and destruction,
every moment?

523
00:45:07,655 --> 00:45:10,783
In truth, behind your
a pious spirit of unholy ideas,

524
00:45:11,091 --> 00:45:12,718
I see the
presence of God!

525
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:15,322
It is questionable,

526
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:19,592
if God really exists, then why?
is there so much maI and injustice,

527
00:45:20,601 --> 00:45:22,796
of war, of maIadie ...

528
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:26,369
of hate, if God can not do
better, so I'm not interested.

529
00:45:27,708 --> 00:45:31,041
Such results do not
not the heart of the Supreme Being.

530
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:34,439
God does not work
(a_on which you imagine.

531
00:45:34,581 --> 00:45:37,175
This is not like _Il
would manage nas actians,

532
00:45:37,284 --> 00:45:39,218
noussommesresponsables
of our actions.

533
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:42,755
This is not like _He was a puppeteer
who draws the stars from our lives,

534
00:45:42,856 --> 00:45:45,791
we are mestotally
responsible for our actions.

535
00:45:46,226 --> 00:45:49,593
In fact, we are the product
of past actions.

536
00:45:51,432 --> 00:45:55,300
So if God is not responsible
what's going on,

537
00:45:55,536 --> 00:45:58,471
What is his role exactly?

538
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:01,163
_quite even having
need a God?

539
00:46:01,408 --> 00:46:05,640
God is like the essence of a car.
Without gas, the car does not drink.

540
00:46:06,313 --> 00:46:08,781
Let's say you have an accident
while driving the car,

541
00:46:09,216 --> 00:46:10,706
who is responable?

542
00:46:11,385 --> 00:46:13,785
The car, the driver
or essence?

543
00:46:14,654 --> 00:46:18,647
The driver decides to
trajectory of the car, not the essence.

544
00:46:19,226 --> 00:46:21,490
But without essence, the
can the car bauble?

545
00:46:21,629 --> 00:46:26,589
Similarly, without the spark
of Life or God,

546
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:31,200
a fisherman can not fish,
neither a monk meditate.

547
00:46:39,179 --> 00:46:40,771
But what is the good of praying?

548
00:46:41,148 --> 00:46:44,606
It can not have d _ ((and on
nas actians, it is logical.

549
00:46:45,285 --> 00:46:48,584
We tend ȧ
underestimate the power and

550
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:48,722
the capacity of our mentai
ȧ guide our actions

551
00:46:52,092 --> 00:46:54,253
and how to make our reality.

552
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:57,428
We act as
we think ...

553
00:46:58,165 --> 00:47:00,725
The free will demands a free spirit.

554
00:47:01,201 --> 00:47:05,035
Where could free will
to come, my dear Ath?

555
00:47:06,039 --> 00:47:11,102
Prayer reinforces the identi ication
with free spirit.

556
00:47:11,945 --> 00:47:14,846
For your mind, prayer
has the same ef (and that

557
00:47:14,982 --> 00:47:18,418
this joy pramenade
of health has on the carps.

558
00:47:18,885 --> 00:47:22,946
And you see we are
arrival at destination.

559
00:47:40,774 --> 00:47:44,039
Hari Om! Ha_j Om! Hari Om!

560
00:47:49,516 --> 00:47:52,713
BaIan, you are a lot of questions

561
00:47:53,086 --> 00:47:55,646
and dont know who can
Spread out at your place.

562
00:47:56,290 --> 00:48:00,727
But there are questions
which only you can answer.

563
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:02,629
These are no longer questions,

564
00:48:04,431 --> 00:48:06,695
_is a quest.

565
00:48:07,401 --> 00:48:10,234
When will you start
your quest,Balan?

566
00:48:16,476 --> 00:48:19,468
AIlo?
- Alla! Mansieur Ram, BaIan ȧ the device.

567
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:19,679
AlIo Balan, how are you?

568
00:48:21,181 --> 00:48:22,512
Very good, I thank you.

569
00:48:23,116 --> 00:48:25,607
Sir, there is more to say about
The sâdhaus that I did not believe,

570
00:48:25,719 --> 00:48:27,812
this particular one is
difficult to pin down.

571
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:31,716
He gets up at dawn, meets people
from around the world,

572
00:48:32,726 --> 00:48:35,320
writes books and manages
even a dispensary.

573
00:48:35,562 --> 00:48:37,427
And he speaks by enigma ...

574
00:48:37,598 --> 00:48:37,598
I think I'm going to need more
time to finalize my interview sir.

575
00:48:40,567 --> 00:48:40,567
Ah, do you?
- Yes.

576
00:48:42,536 --> 00:48:44,800
OK, take your time.
- Thank you sir.

577
00:48:45,105 --> 00:48:46,595
Good luck BaIan!

578
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:50,139
Hari Om.

579
00:49:05,325 --> 00:49:07,885
The carcinogenic issues
life and death,

580
00:49:07,995 --> 00:49:10,259
creation and existence,

581
00:49:10,431 --> 00:49:13,594
prayer and its poor
found an answer here.

582
00:49:14,434 --> 00:49:14,434
These fundamental ideas
that I saw through

583
00:49:17,671 --> 00:49:21,573
the arrogance of my education, or
from my basic knowledge,

584
00:49:22,075 --> 00:49:25,272
seem to me suddenly well
certainties that I had.

585
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:26,046
But for once, I
do not act by

586
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:28,571
the fact that I do not know
not all of them.

587
00:49:31,451 --> 00:49:35,581
Man heart is at peace and
Filled with enthusiasm

588
00:49:35,722 --> 00:49:39,214
while I am
into the unknown...

589
00:50:15,629 --> 00:50:18,291
Do you know what you're looking for BaIan?

590
00:50:19,199 --> 00:50:21,167
I'll know it when I find it.

591
00:50:21,334 --> 00:50:22,699
You said you
had questions?

592
00:50:23,036 --> 00:50:23,036
Yes, uh .. a long list ...

593
00:50:24,571 --> 00:50:28,507
Cesquestionsquetuasdanstapache,
I can answer it in fifteen minutes

594
00:50:28,642 --> 00:50:31,611
and this interview will be over, you
will be able to leave, mission accomplished.

595
00:50:31,778 --> 00:50:35,179
But is it really _a that
do you want to know Balan? _ėfIėchis.

596
00:50:35,382 --> 00:50:38,476
Do you have questians, or
are you looking for?

597
00:50:35,382 --> 00:50:35,382
The Prashna Upanishad tells
the story of six students

598
00:50:43,657 --> 00:50:43,657
who met the Rishi Pipallada

599
00:50:45,592 --> 00:50:47,719
to clarify their doubts.

600
00:50:48,228 --> 00:50:48,228
Instead of answering taut
immediately, he asked

601
00:50:52,265 --> 00:50:56,292
to practice celibacy and austerity
for a year in his ashram.

Put your questians next to BaIan.
What is your quest?

00:51:15,022 --> 00:51:17,217
I was on my bed
dead there are some but

608
00:51:17,457 --> 00:51:19,152
and now see me here.

609
00:51:19,426 --> 00:51:22,657
Man friend was in full health and
He died without reason.

610
00:51:23,396 --> 00:51:26,058
He is dead and I continue to live.

611
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:26,400
I want a response to that.

612
00:51:27,801 --> 00:51:27,801
Would you say that _ is a
question or a quest?

613
00:51:30,003 --> 00:51:33,962
It depends on the intensity
of your self (of answer.

614
00:51:44,051 --> 00:51:46,315
Observe the divine in the work.

How can there be a

617
00:52:16,650 --> 00:52:22,282
Part of tai, ȧ this
moment, is non-acting,

618
00:52:22,823 --> 00:52:26,418
it is the observer, the sâkshi,

619
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:31,759
the witness of all actions,
physical and mental.

620
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:37,101
This part of you, this canscience

621
00:52:37,270 --> 00:52:41,206
is always present, it is the '' non-act ''.

622
00:53:32,358 --> 00:53:34,292
AlIo, Mr. Ram?
- Yes Balan.

00:53:39,532 --> 00:53:41,830
I minire and wonder
if you come back someday.

626
00:53:42,836 --> 00:53:42,836
Of course I will come back,
_is just that ...

Of course I will come back,
_is just that ...

00:53:48,208 --> 00:53:51,405
Just what?
Do you have any questions?

629
00:53:52,579 --> 00:53:56,447
AlIo! AIlo Balan! Are you here? Hello?

630
00:54:04,691 --> 00:54:08,218
And at the moment when I arrive ȧ
this stage of my quest,

631
00:54:08,361 --> 00:54:11,296
I have the impression of having developed
more quality in a month

632
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:11,498
that all my life.

633
00:54:14,334 --> 00:54:14,857
that all my life.

00:54:15,302 --> 00:54:17,361
I do not know why.. .

635
00:54:17,804 --> 00:54:20,295
I always thought I knew everything.

636
00:54:21,574 --> 00:54:23,769
But see the events of my life

637
00:54:23.910 --> 00:54:23.910
tell me that life itself remains
the greatest of mysteries.

Now, here I am ...

00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:34,582

00:55:21,534 --> 00:55:21,534
can I also be initiated in the order
sannyasa (renonants)?

647
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:24,301
can I also be initiated in the order
sannyasa (renonants)?

648
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:24,404
You're not ready.

649
00:55:26,205 --> 00:55:29,936
It's been a few months since you
have arrived in this ashram.

650
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:33,680
But there is Vėritė there, I do not see any
reason to persist in the material world,

652
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:41,076
Be patient, be patient BaIan!

Give yourself maybe six

to make sure that _is well
a sincere vocation

655
00:55:46,059 --> 00:55:49,551
and not a mere passenger craze.

00:55:56,269 --> 00:55:56,269
I thought you did not
would never come back!

657
00:55:58,171 --> 00:56:00,105
Your retaur is triumphal to Baian,

658
00:56:00,507 --> 00:56:04,739
next week you will definitely be able to get back
the prize for the best junior journalist of the year!

659
00:56:05,111 --> 00:56:05,111
I heard that you
are the favorite of the jury!

660

I heard that you
are the favorite of the jury!

In addition, I give you a pramotion,
well played Balan!

662
00:56:13,419 --> 00:56:15,387
What could we want
more in life?

663
00:56:15,555 --> 00:56:15,555
Sau (perhaps to make the happiness of his
parents by starting a family.

664
00:56:19,459 --> 00:56:19,550
Sau (perhaps to make the happiness of his
parents by starting a family.

665
00:56:21,094 --> 00:56:21,094
I'm sure there are hundreds
of parents of young people (girls

666
00:56:23,263 --> 00:56:23,263
who would queue up
a young son-in-law like you!

667
00:56:25,432 --> 00:56:25,432
Three months of that ... three months.

668
00:56:28,201 --> 00:56:31,728
And he asks me what could
to wait more in life. ..

669
00:56:32,105 --> 00:56:32,105
I started with the inttentian of
to hide the sadhus of this world,

670
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:35,634
I started with the inttentian of
to hide the sadhus of this world,

671
00:56:35,742 --> 00:56:40,042
I'm afraid I could not
to hide only one,

672
00:56:42,749 --> 00:56:46,185
who really counts:

673
00:56:47,754 --> 00:56:50,314
the sadhau that is in May.

674
00:56:51,291 --> 00:56:53,782
You must have permission
from your parents,

675
00:56:54,127 --> 00:56:57,187
to the next Shiva Ratri, naus will teach you
in the sannyasa.

676
00:56:59,699 --> 00:56:59,699
Questions,
Mr. Reporter?

677
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,399
Questions,
Mr. Reporter?

678
00:57:16,249 --> 00:57:19,184
I would never have thought

679
00:57:19,252 --> 00:57:23,086
that Balan would follow the spiritual path,
He wants to become Sannyasi.

680
00:57:23,323 --> 00:57:24,654
Ah, good.

681
00:57:26,393 --> 00:57:26,393
I always knew that despite everything
what he said, he had it in him.

682
00:57:29,028 --> 00:57:32,054
I always knew that despite everything
what he said, he had it in him.

683
00:57:32,165 --> 00:57:32,165
I remember that Mom was telling us
often how, when it was very small,

684
00:57:36,169 --> 00:57:36,169
the Saint Chattambi Swamigal chuchated him
teachings in the house ...

685
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:40,340
Maybe naus do not understand that
now what this 5wami already knew about BaIan.

686
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:41,898
Maybe naus do not understandthan
now what this 5wami already knew about BaIan.

687
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:40,340
Om. Limmartalitė does not contain
by the association with the Lord

688
00:57:57,056 --> 00:57:57,545
Om. Limmartalitė does not contain
by the association with the Lord

689
00:57:57,757 --> 00:58:02,524
and not by his merits

690
00:58:04,297 --> 00:58:04,297
neither by his efforts nor by his offspring
neither by its wealth

691
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:11,127
neither by his efforts nor by his offspring
neither by its wealth

692
00:58:12,538 --> 00:58:19,307
but only the renunciation
leads to immortality.

693
00:58:34,461 --> 00:58:38,261
You will now be known as
Swami Chinmayananda Saraswati.

694
00:59:03,890 --> 00:59:06,484
I started you on a quest

695
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:10,923
but your thirst for knowledge
can not be sealed

696
00:59:11,064 --> 00:59:13,032
drinking at the source.

697
00:59:13,099 --> 00:59:16,262
For that, you must go to Swami's house
Tapovanam in the Himalayas

698
00:59:16,802 --> 00:59:19,362
_
to learn directly
Sacred Scripture.

699
00:59:19,772 --> 00:59:19,772
Remember this:of belief
In faith, the journey is long.

700
00:59:20,139 --> 00:59:24,542
Remember this:of belief
In faith, the journey is long.

701
00:59:24,777 --> 00:59:28,110
Be patient Balan,
very patient.. .

a very strict master,

709
01:00:02,181 --> 01:00:02,545
a very strict master,

710
01:00:02,615 --> 01:00:04,310
a full compassian mentor

711
01:00:04,417 --> 01:00:09,377
and a father whose every word
vibrates with ecstatic awareness.

712
01:00:10,223 --> 01:00:14,387
A wise man ȧ I know
and in unequal calm,

713
01:00:14,727 --> 01:00:14,727

a gurau by (have, ėrudit and rėaIisė
(5hrotiya and Brahmanishta).

715
01:01:16,189 --> 01:01:19,989
I can not believe it to be really
become a monk (take Deeksha).

716
01:01:20,126 --> 01:01:22,822
I mean, he looked so much like me.

717
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:25,489
Really ? I would like you
see fighting for your country,

718
01:01:25,798 --> 01:01:27,459
you would not even dream
the little finger for me.

719
01:01:27,533 --> 01:01:27,533
That's not what I mean.

720
01:01:30,102 --> 01:01:30,102
I mean it was exceptionally
brave and that he has done so much for the country.

721
01:01:35,074 --> 01:01:38,373
He listened to his heart,
He sought the truth.

722
01:01:39.412 --> 01:01:40.401
OKAY.

723
01:01:40,713 --> 01:01:45,514
So, lots of questions

01:01:46.185 --> 01:01:48.119

It's better now.

How is Swamiji's health?

01:03:47,673 --> 01:03:49,265
She goes as she should to aIler.

Paurquoi (area all this way
to take a bath, Swamiji?

741
01:03:52,878 --> 01:03:56,678
Let us build you a
ashram, _a would be a lot better. ..

742
01:03:57,950 --> 01:03:57,950
You have seen with what care

_is so that I can find it
easily tomorrow.

_to maintain a single garment
It is already effortless.

I do not wish to lose my
time to keep anything else ...

747
01:04:12,431 --> 01:04:14,763
I do not wish to lose my
time to keep whatwhatever else ...

748
01:04:14,967 --> 01:04:18,368
I'm satisfied with this hut
with clay walls.

749
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:39,125
Hari Om Swamiji, I
Chinmaya.

750
01:04:40,459 --> 01:04:40,459
Hari Om Swamiji, I
Chinmaya.

751
01:04:42,294 --> 01:04:45,092
I was sent by Swami
Shivanandapourvousrencontrer.

752
01:04:45,297 --> 01:04:47,663
I would like to study
the Upanishads.

753
01:04:47,767 --> 01:04:50,292
could you guide me if he liked?
I would like to know Vėritė.

754
01:04:50,403 --> 01:04:50,403

Do you have his recommendation letter?

755
01:04:54,206 --> 01:04:54,206
Just ask me
to meet you.

01:04:54,473 --> 01:04:54,473
Just ask me
to meet you.

757
01:04:55,775 --> 01:04:55,775
What?

758
01:04:57,143 --> 01:04:57,143
Uh, 5wamiji ... iI m_ just
said to come see you.

759
01:05:00,713 --> 01:05:01,680
_ourquai?

760
01:05:02,081 --> 01:05:04,675
Uh ... I just got started
as renon_ant and ...

761
01:05:04,750 --> 01:05:08,049
You heard what I said,
go get the letter and come back!

762
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:47,622
Swamiji, do you think he was lying?
- No, he said the truth.

763
01:05:47,826 --> 01:05:49,350
So why?
the avair returned?

764
01:05:49,495 --> 01:05:53,556
This knowledge is precious, elIe
must be taken and not just dannėe.

765
01:05:53,832 --> 01:05:56,300
Let's see that point he is sincere.

766
01:05:56,602 --> 01:05:58,229
I saw that _ė was a mumukshu,
(ardent aspirant to Iibration)

767
01:05:58,337 --> 01:06:00,032
I know he'll come back.

768
01:06:00,173 --> 01:06:04,041
But this pigeon will make him more
vigilant and eager to learn.

769
01:06:33,773 --> 01:06:35,297
C_stbon, vouspouvezl'envoyer.

770
01:06:35,408 --> 01:06:36,841
Okay, swamiji, I'll let him go.

771
01:06:37,142 --> 01:06:37,142
Chinmaya! You are from
return as quickly!

772
01:06:39,845 --> 01:06:42,279
You have already mastered
Upanishads?

773
01:06:43,449 --> 01:06:47,146
Gurudev, Swami Tapavan asked for a
letter to prove that I come from here ...

774
01:06:47,253 --> 01:06:49,346
Ah OK,
give may _a.

775
01:06:49,555 --> 01:06:53,082
Swamiji, but why do not you
not dannė this letter before?

776
01:06:53,158 --> 01:06:56,685
Chinmaya, do not you see that I
just test your patience?

777
01:06:57,296 --> 01:07:00,527
I do not understand why iI
must test me from this (a_an,

778
01:07:00,632 --> 01:07:02,532
I have already renounced
everything I had.

779
01:07:02,601 --> 01:07:04,569
Let it be the only
judge in this matter.

780
01:07:04,670 --> 01:07:10,302
_our the moment, do not let his actions
neither its props disturb you inutiIement.

781
01:07:10,876 --> 01:07:16,280
A teacher does not bother
your pains or your sorrows,

782
01:07:16,649 --> 01:07:20,346
He only preaches himself
Tan pragrės spiritual,

783
01:07:20,519 --> 01:07:21,850
nothing else.

784
01:07:32,631 --> 01:07:35,657
Govindagiri! _ending rain
from yesterday the roof is thrown away,

785
01:07:35,768 --> 01:07:38,862
since there is dirty naus paursuivrons

786
01:07:39,271 --> 01:07:41,262
In addition, the books were wiped,

787
01:07:41,373 --> 01:07:45,207
iI (to make them dry outside
very carefully.

788
01:07:45,578 --> 01:07:45,578
Inside, there are fruits that
the maharani (the queen) has envayės,

789
01:07:47,780 --> 01:07:50,146
take them and share them
with others, please.

790
01:07:50,316 --> 01:07:51,544
Go help him too.

791
01:07:51,617 --> 01:07:51,617
I'm sure he's going to get it
evening and today we have to ...

792
01:07:54,587 --> 01:07:57,215
Hari Om Swamiji, I have the letter.

793
01:07:57,790 --> 01:07:59,917
Keep it with you.

794
01:08:00,659 --> 01:08:01,887
Do you want to study with me?

795
01:08:01,961 --> 01:08:03,724
Yes Swamiji.

796
01:08:04,463 --> 01:08:05,896
There are some conditions.

797
01:08:06,198 --> 01:08:09,395
One:What I teach, I do not

798
01:08:09,602 --> 01:08:11,934
Two:I want to get your attention.

Three:interditdeprendredesnotes.

800
01:08:14,473 --> 01:08:18,500
And for (inir, you have to assimilate
perfectly what I will have taught you,

801
01:08:18,711 --> 01:08:18,711
if you can not answer me when
I'll ask you a questian, you're leaving on the field.

802
01:08:23,649 --> 01:08:23,649
Do you accept these conditions?

803
01:08:25,451 --> 01:08:26,748
D_cord Swamiji.

804
01:08:26.986 --> 01:08:32.322
See you tomorrow at 4 o'clock in the morning.
- Hari Om Swamiji.

805
01:08:50,943 --> 01:08:50,943
What are the students?

806
01:08:52,678 --> 01:08:52,678
Beaucaupviennent, peurestent.

807
01:08:55,481 --> 01:08:58,541
p
You are already a 5wami,
Why did you come here?

808
01:08:59,518 --> 01:09:02,282Illumination is very di (ėrente
a simple initiation.

809
01:09:04,457 --> 01:09:09,156
Today we will discuss on a shIoka
(verse) of Ishâvâsya Upanishad.

810
01:09:09,395 --> 01:09:12,626
Om iishâ vâsyam idagam sarvam

811
01:09:12,732 --> 01:09:17,294
yat kinchajagatyam jagat
tena tyatena bhunjitha

krita kasya swid dhanam

813
01:09:20,572 --> 01:09:20,572
All this, all that is
moves in the universe,

814
01:09:23,743 --> 01:09:27,736
including this universe, is imprėgnė
of the presence of the 5th Lord.

815
01:09:28,181 --> 01:09:28,181
_ar cansėquent, detach you
and enjoy,

816
01:09:31,650 --> 01:09:34,778
never covet Ie
many others.

817
01:09:38,190 --> 01:09:41,216
Swamiji, I have a doubt about
This morning's class,

818
01:09:41,393 --> 01:09:46,194
tena tyaktena, the detachment
does the abandonment mean?

819
01:09:46,432 --> 01:09:50,198
You see Chinmaya, only the one who is
dėtachė can really prafiter.

820
01:09:50,736 --> 01:09:54,536
If you know how to detach yourself,
you really enjoy life.

821
01:09:55,140 --> 01:09:59,042
Intellectually and theoretically I
understand, but ...

822
01:10:01,313 --> 01:10:04,305
Do you see this mountain?

823
01:10:05,150 --> 01:10:07,141
Is not it beautiful?

824
01:10:09,221 --> 01:10:11,121
You have appreciated it.

825
01:10:12.191 --> 01:10:12.191
Yes of course.. .

826
01:10:13,492 --> 01:10:15,084
Were you attached to it?

827
01:10:15,194 --> 01:10:16,388
No_

828
01:10:16,562 --> 01:10:20,362
This is because you did not laugh at the impressian
that the mantain belongs to you.

829
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:23,425
But you appreciated it,
is not it?

830
01:10:24,703 --> 01:10:27,638
Learn to see things
but without owning them.

831
01:10:36,549 --> 01:10:38,574
Have you lost that?

832
01:10:38,818 --> 01:10:42,549
Swamiji, it had already been torn, I
just put it dry.

833
01:10:42,788 --> 01:10:46,622
How dare you think you're a liar!
You've torn my shirt!

834
01:10:48,460 --> 01:10:50,655
I am not a liar.. .

835
01:10:59,371 --> 01:11:03,205
You saw _a, so much calorie for
an old piece of cloth.

It had been lost for a long time
and we all knew it. ..

840
01:11:22,094 --> 01:11:26,258
Chinmaya, if you want to do
The experience of Vėritė,

01:11:54,726 --> 01:11:57,695
to study underfoot
of a liar.

844
01:12:01,300 --> 01:12:05,031

cally a person arrives
ȧ this state of perfection?

852
01:13:24,449 --> 01:13:27,941
The researcher, Chinmaya, must
(wavers his words in the mind,

853
01:13:28,053 --> 01:13:30,248
the mind must stand in the intelect

854

and the intellect in the Supreme Self.

855
01:13:32,892 --> 01:13:37,158
The researcher thus looks in a
State of absolute peace and perfection.

No, I will rather save the
Poissans from the hands of the monkeys!

892
01:18:27,886 --> 01:18:29,786
But who will save the monkey?

seen from his work for the moment.

01:19:56,441 --> 01:19:57,601
This is the sequel.

01:19:57,776 --> 01:20:01,576

A speaker who speaks English?
It is impassible!

01:23:35,193 --> 01:23:36,421
Do not lie !

961

That's for sure, I'm bringing man husband tomorrow

966
01:24:10.462 --> 01:24:14.421
Swamiji, I promise you there will be
at least ten people here tomorrow.

967
01:24:15,133 --> 01:24:15,133
Encores a Swamiji word, I have a question
About today's heap.

968
01:24:18,269 --> 01:24:21,568
You too ? Or have I already heard that?

969
01:24:45,730 --> 01:24:48,392
Here I am!
_I am here!

970
01:24:56.508 --> 01:25:00.274
Um, I'm going to have more people.

971
01:25:00,778 --> 01:25:04,214
for ten people,
no need for microphone.

972
01:25:06,050 --> 01:25:07,244
_ranaam 5wamiji!

973
01:25:07,318 --> 01:25:07,318
Yesterday we discussed
deBrahmaVidyâ

974
01:25:10,154 --> 01:25:12,987
that we mainly work
in the Upanishads.

975
01:25:13,358 --> 01:25:13,358
We have ten major Upanishads.

976
01:25:16,060 --> 01:25:20,053
Bhagavan5hankara, _amânujaet Madhva

977
01:25:16.060 --> 01:25:20.019
have written comments on
these ten major Upanishads.

978
01:25:24,569 --> 01:25:28,630
Among them, we are
Study the Kena Upanishad.

979
01:25:52,897 --> 01:25:52,897
Once upon a time there was a man
who was bathing in the Ganges.

980
01:25:56,334 --> 01:26:01,795
He saw a rattan cane with a handle
in silver, flatter on the river.

981
01:26:02,674 --> 01:26:07,373
Immediately, he seizes
and returned to the shore.

982
01:26:08,313 --> 01:26:08,313
Alars he was approaching, the cane
He escaped his hands

983
01:26:11,349 --> 01:26:14,785
and he began to cry out with sorrow:
"My cane, my cane!"

984
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:17,911
This cane that fished on the river

985
01:26:17.989 --> 01:26:20.480
never caused him
The least problem.

986
01:26:20,692 --> 01:26:20,692
This is the relationship that I had
created between him and the cane

987
01:26:23,995 --> 01:26:26,691
who was the cause of
all his sadnesses.

988
01:26:28,433 --> 01:26:28,433
These are not the objects of
this world who are the cause

989
01:26:31,169 --> 01:26:33,262
of all the miseries of the world.

990
01:26:33,538 --> 01:26:33,538
C_st lfeeling of possession that
we talk to you about it

991
01:26:36.307 --> 01:26:36.307
who is the cause
of all our sorrows.

992
01:26:39,010 --> 01:26:42,104
Tomorrow we will study
the nature of ega:

993
01:26:42,413 --> 01:26:45,905
the one in us,
Feel and _ense.

994
01:26:50,888 --> 01:26:53,914

Iadhus and distribute them.

to maintain discipline.

1143

Make it as easy as Chinmaya,

In Delhi, there are better doctors there.

People do not die in Delhi?

1165
01:38:18,642 --> 01:38:22,169
Gurudev, I have to go back ȧ
Bombay and then ȧ Palagath

1166

A hėra of the Himalayas!

Do you prepare them all

1174
01:39:13,264 --> 01:39:13,264
Swamiji, there is a big
thirst for knowledge

1175
01:39:16,567 --> 01:39:19,092
but no access to the good
spiritual source ...

1176
01:39:19,469 --> 01:39:19,469
If one does not drink their arid life

1177
01:39:21.438 --> 01:39:21.438
we could lose
our culture - never ..

1178
01:39:23,441 --> 01:39:25,204
Do you have in mind?

1179
01:39:25.576 --> 01:39:30.036
A monastery in the pies or the
researchers will be able to study.

1180
01:39:31,382 --> 01:39:35,284
I would like to build an army of monks
to raise and rejuvenate our culture.

1181
01:39:36,186 --> 01:39:38,154
I would like to call him
Sandeep any Sâdhanâ Iaya.

1182

Rishi Sandeepany was the guru of
Shri Krishna and since you teach

1183
01:39:41,758 --> 01:39:45,125
the Bhagavad Gita is very
sinking, _is wonderful!

1184
01:39:49,199 --> 01:39:50,632

01:40:42.385 --> 01:40:45.354
It's a story incredibly
heroic, Nalini.

I am so admired (of his life
and what he did.

1189
01:40:50,227 --> 01:40:55,426

true Ieader and a visionary!

1191

A monk so I mean.

1192
01:41:05,542 --> 01:41:05,542
But I am sure that such a course

1193
01:41:08,312 --> 01:41:10,542
in such a short time had to
It cost him health.

1194
01:41:10,814 --> 01:41:10,814
Of course, after all this
was only a man

1195
01:41:13,750 --> 01:41:15,775
but what distinguished him
from you and May

1196
01:41:16,087 --> 01:41:19,318
_is he was able to dominate
san body using his mind.

1197
01:41:20.457 --> 01:41:20.457
Once, he had to
give a long speech

Swamiji, it would be better if
Swamiji could write it to me.

I think she must have been very disappointed.

1262
01:47:13,376 --> 01:47:16,243
Yes, but Swamiji has spread it
in saying:

'' Rest '' Delhi, August 6th you'll do them
